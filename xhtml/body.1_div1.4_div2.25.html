            <p>All sentences other than simple sentences are formed by combining simple
              sentences either by coördination or subordination. </p>

            <p>Coördination produces compound sentences, subordination produces complex
              sentences. Complex sentences have been developed out of coördinate independent
              sentences, one of which has been subordinated in form, as in thought, to another. </p>

            <p>Comparative Grammar shows that, historically, coördination was preceded
              by simple juxtaposition and followed by subordination. Thus the simplest form of
              associating the two ideas <span class="term">night fell</span> and <span class="term">the enemy departed</span> was <span class="foreign">νὺξ ἐγένετο· οἱ πολέμιοι ἀπῆλθον</span> (or in reverse order). From this was
              developed a closer connection by means of coördinating conjunctions, e.g. <span class="foreign">νὺξ</span> (<span class="foreign">μὲν</span>) <span class="foreign">ἐγένετο, οἱ
                δὲ πολέμιοι ἀπῆλθον</span> or <span class="foreign">οἱ δὲ
                πολέμιοι ἀπῆλθον· νὺξ ἐγένετο</span> (or <span class="foreign">νὺξ γὰρ ἐγένετο</span>), or <span class="foreign">νὺξ ἐγένετο
                καὶ οἱ πολέμιοι ἀπῆλθον</span>. Finally it was recognized that one of these ideas
              was a mere explanation, definition, or supplement of the other, and hence dependent or
              subordinate. This stage is represented by the <i>complex</i> sentence: <span class="foreign">ἐπεὶ</span>
                (<span class="foreign">ὅτε</span>) <span class="foreign">νὺξ ἐγένετο, οἱ πολέμιοι ἀπῆλθον</span> or <span class="foreign">νὺξ ἐγένετο, ὥστε οί πολέμιοι ἀπῆλθον</span>, and
              so on to express various other relations. Since Greek inherited from the parent
              Indo-European language both the subordinate and the coördinate sentence, it must be
              clearly understood that the above examples of the process of development of
              sentence-building, though taken from Greek, illustrate an earlier period of the
              history of language than Greek as we have it. Though it may be possible to reconstruct
              the form of the earlier, coördinate sentence out of the later, subordinate sentence,
              and though we have examples of parallel coördinate and subordinate sentences in Greek,
              the subordinate sentence did not <i>in Greek</i>
              regularly go through the previous stages of simple juxtaposition and coördination. A
              subordinate construction produced by analogy to another subordinate construction may
              not be resolved into the coördinate form. </p>
