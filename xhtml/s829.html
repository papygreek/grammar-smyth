          <p>Suffixes forming primitive words are called <span class="term">primary</span> suffixes; suffixes forming denominative words are called <span class="term">secondary</span> suffixes. </p>
          <p><b>a.</b> The distinction between primary
            and secondary suffixes is not original and is often neglected. Thus, in <span class="foreign">δεινός</span>
            <span class="gloss">terrible</span> (<span class="foreign">δει-</span>
            <span class="gloss">fear</span>), <span class="foreign">νο</span> is a primary suffix; in <span class="foreign">σκοτεινός</span>
            <span class="gloss">dark</span> (<span class="foreign">σκότος</span>, 858. <a class="link_ref" href="body.1_div1.1_div2.1.html#s11" title="">11</a>), it is
            secondary. So English <i>-able</i> is both primary
              (<span class="gloss">readable</span>) and secondary (<span class="gloss">companionable</span>). </p>
          <p><b>b.</b> It is often difficult to
            determine whether a suffix is added to a verb-stem or to a noun-stem: <span class="foreign">ἰσχῡ-ρός</span>
            <span class="gloss">strong</span> (<span class="foreign">ἰσχύ̄-ς</span>
            <span class="gloss">strength</span>, <span class="foreign">ἰσχύ̄-ω</span>
            <span class="gloss">am strong</span>). </p>
          <p><b>c.</b> A primitive word may be formed
            from a verb-stem which is itself denominative: <span class="foreign">τοξευ-τής</span>
            <span class="gloss">bowman</span> from <span class="foreign">τοξεύ-ω</span>
            <span class="gloss">shoot with the bow</span>, derived from <span class="foreign">τόξο-ν</span>
            <span class="gloss">bow</span>. A primitive may be formed with a suffix derived from
            a denominative: <span class="foreign">φλεγ-υρό-ς</span>
            <span class="gloss">burning</span> (<span class="foreign">φλέγ-ω</span>
            <span class="gloss">burn</span>) with <span class="foreign">υρο</span> from <span class="foreign">λιγυ-ρό-ς</span>
              (<span class="foreign">λιγύ-ς</span>) <span class="gloss">shrill</span>. </p>
          <p><b>d.</b> A denominative often has no
            corresponding primitive; sometimes the latter has been lost, sometimes it was presumed
            for the purpose of word-formation by the imitative process always at work in the making
            of language. Thus, <span class="foreign">δέμ-ν-ιο-ν</span>
            <span class="gloss">bed</span>, from <span class="foreign">δεμ-νο-ν</span> (<span class="foreign">δέμ-ω</span>
            <span class="gloss">build</span>, <span class="gloss">construct</span>). </p>
